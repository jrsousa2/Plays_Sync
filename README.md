### Applet to sync play counts between iTunes and Windows Media Player

This is an applet that lets a user sync the play counts of their iTunes and Windows Media Player libraries. 

It will be made available on Gumroad (at a very affordable price) shortly. Unlike others I've seen this one runs very fast, because it relies on the iTunes library XML file, which is much faster to load than scanning the entire iTunes music database. Unfortunately there is no such file for WMP, but reading the WMP library is a little faster anyway.

This time I've used wxFormBuilder to create a more native-looking GUI than the first applet I created, which used TkInter. 

Here are some snapshot that illustrate how the program works. 


Of course the program will only work if the user has both iTunes and WMP installed on Windows (no Mac version for now).
